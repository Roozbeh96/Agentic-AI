## 1. 🛠️ Installing Poetry

To install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) (Python dependency management and packaging tool), run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

After installation, make sure Poetry is in your `PATH`
- macOS/Linux
```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH
```

Verify installation:

```bash
poetry version
```

Keep venv inside the project (works great with VS Code) poetry 

```bash
config virtualenvs.in-project true
```
This environment is set with Python 3.13. Change the requires-python = ">=3.13" in pyproject.tmol file if you have other versions on your PC.

run:
```bash
poetry install
```

In case if you want to make environment from scratch, run:(Do not recommended)

```bash
poetry new project_name
```

## 2. Download Ollama installer

Ollama is like a car that you can use different engines(models) for your job[Ollama](https://ollama.com/download).<br>

Then in the terminal, paste the following line to install the model on the Ollama.<br>

```bash
ollama run llama3.1
```

To exit from the Ollama, use `/bye` in macOs and `Ctrl+d` in window.<br>

## 3. Connecting Langchain to llama

First, you  need to install `langchain` on the the virtual environment. In the terminal whre the `pyproject.toml` is locating, paste the following commands:
```bash
poetry add langchain
poetry add langchain_community
poetry add langchain-ollama
poetry add pandas
poetry add openpyxl
poetry add ipykernel
```

To install langchain, you should have python >=3.10. If you get error regarding the range of the python, change this line `requires-python = ">=Your-python-version"` in `pyproject.toml` to `requires-python = ">=Your-python-version"`(removing ">=").<br>

After installing the langchain, there is `sample.py` file in the `test` directory, that tested the connection of langchain with llama model installed locally by asking simple question in the prompt. The parameter `temperature` control randomness. Since we want to be precise, it should be zero. Ollama is running on the localhost `127.0.0.1 or localhost` with port number `11434`, so if you paste `curl 127.0.0.1:11434` in terminal, you will see Ollama is running.
